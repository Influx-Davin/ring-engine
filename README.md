# Welcome
After all these years of work I've decided to create a repository showing all of my work. The project is not finished but I'll continue to update until we have a clean and good version of the Ring Engine.

# Must Know
Many files like objects scripts will be removed because I want to make it more flexible. Currently the file structure is fully locked into Sonic Generations and this will be removed in the future. The intention of creating a Sonic game that will reuse levels that already existed no longer makes sense to me. It will also make it easier to clean useless files. XML Reader, GIA Lightmaps, GIA Shaders still present on this version but also will be removed in the future.

# Source Code
Here we have a lots of types of source code, begginer codes, intermediate codes and advanced codes. Remember, this project teach me how to program in C#. Code will be optimized with time for better reading and performance. The source code in here is fully open source, there some third part codes too, but remember I've spend many years on this! When you share, remember to credit me or the respective owner.

# Problems
It's a big project, there a lot of know bugs that I didn't have time to fix yet.

# Finally
I hope everyone who reached to this repository like the content and have fun using Ring Engine.
